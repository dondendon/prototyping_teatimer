# Tea Timer with Pressure Sensor, 4-Digit 7-Segment Display, and toggle switches

# Introduction
This is the project for the **Prototyping for Interaction Design** class, with the intend to integrate physical and digital prototyping. We will be creating a prototype for a proof of concept with Arduino.

# My Concept

I create design a timer for tea making, with a switch to set up the time, pressure sensor to trigger the timer, and a 4-digit LCD screen signifier to show the output.

# Why Tea Timer?

The time of tea bag in the hot water will affect the quality of tea. However, there's no convenience timer for the current tea making process. One has to use a phone or alarm to set up every time. And the Hourglass provides limited flexibility. Therefore, I designed this timer that seamlessly integrates into the tea making process. The user only needs to put the cup on the timer, and they'll be notified after the countdown. Moreover, the user doesn't have to set up the switch every time, the Arduino board will automatically read the current setting to start.

# What do you need?
1. ARDUINO UNO
2. 4-Digit 7-Segment Display
3. A Pressure Sensor
4. Jumper wires (generic)
5. Toggle Switches
